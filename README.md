# Github-Game-Configs

I often receive requests for my game and configuration settings. <br>
Due to time constraints, I am often unable to post game optimization, FPS, and latency video guides. <br>
However, I will share updated configs and settings for all the games I tweak here.<br>

Feel free to use these configurations as a base to potentially improve performance.<br>

I hope you find them helpful.<br>
