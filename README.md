# Github-Game-Configs

I often receive requests for my game and configuration settings. <br>
Due to time constraints, I am often unable to post game optimization, FPS, and latency video guides. <br>
However, I will share updated configs and settings for all the games I tweak here.<br>

I hope you find them helpful.<br>

# About
Feel free to use these configurations as a starting point to potentially improve performance.<br>
Users may need to adjust bindings, sensitivity, refresh rate, and resolution according to their preferences.<br>
Keep in mind that many settings are subjective, so please don't consider these configurations as definitive.<br>
Owners of high-end GPUs can afford to experiment with higher graphic settings if desired.<br>


# Nvidia Reflex?
Nvidia Reflex reduces latency by optimizing the rendering pipeline across the CPU and GPU, removing stalls by synchronizing each step of the pipeline.<br>
Reflex is most effective when the system is GPU-bound—or when the GPU is under high utilization—as it prevents the CPU from racing ahead of the GPU, which can cause a buildup in the render queue, increasing latency.<br>
Any Nvidia card user, regardless of being GPU-bound, should always use Reflex.

Unfortunately, most people focus only on framerate, which is why Nvidia Reflex is highlighted here.

Enabled/On
- No loss in framerate
- Lower system latency
- Most configs are set to this

Enabled/On + Boost
- May loose up to 20 fps
- Even more lower system latency
- Reccomended setting

Remember, while FPS is important, system latency matters more.
